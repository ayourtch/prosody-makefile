I thought one day to play with Prosody (http://prosody.im/).

But I wanted to keep its install separate.

Here's the Makefile that appears to do this, at least on my system.

At the moment it will install Prosody 0.6.1 and the minimum required libs.

Let me know (ayourtch@gmail.com) what you think of this.

http://prosody.im/source/mit - that's a link to the license for these two files.
