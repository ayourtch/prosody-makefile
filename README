I thought one day to play with Prosody (http://prosody.im/).

But I wanted to keep its install separate.

Here's the Makefile that appears to do this, at least on my system.

At the moment it will install Prosody 0.6.1 and the minimum required libs.

Let me know (ayourtch@gmail.com) if it was of any use for you or
if it somehow did not work. No guarantees whatsoever (I "license" this makefile same way as Prosody itself is licensed - http://prosody.im/source/mit) - but
I'll see if I can help.
